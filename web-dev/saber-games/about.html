                    <p>This website was created by Vlad Rakhmanin as part of his MSc Computer Science (Conversion) course, specifically for an assignment in the Web Application Development module. [saber//games] is intended to be a demo of a general purpose site providing reviews, news and opinion pieces in connection with the video game industry.</p>
                    <p>In order to pay homage to the modern industry’s Japanese roots, Vlad has taken heavy inspiration from Japanese pop culture for the visual style of the site, which features exuberant, bright colours and loud sans-serif fonts (without sacrificing usability or readability).</p>
                    <p>You can keep up with Vlad’s other side projects, or view the latest games that he has played, by checking out his public GitHub and Grouvee accounts, both of which are linked below.</p>
