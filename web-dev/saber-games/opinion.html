            <h4 class="opinion-text-line">As a massive fan of the original Tomb Raider games, as well as the Legend / Anniversary / Underworld trilogy, I was very disappointed by the direction that the new reboots took.</h4>

            <p>The 2013 game was a solid Uncharted clone but not what I was looking for in a Tomb Raider game, so I ignored the sequels when they came out. Recently, I decided to play through both Rise and Shadow because I was looking for a short, simple AAA story experience, and while that was exactly what I got from Rise, Shadow ended up being a massive surprise to me, as it focused entirely on the aspects on the franchise that I personally enjoy, and that I thought this reboot trilogy had abandoned. It was especially surprising as I had seen many people say that it's by far the worst entry in the new trilogy. 
                
            <p>Generally speaking, the Tomb Raider reboots were games that removed a lot of the glamorous, globe-trotting adventure that the franchise was well known for, and instead replaced it with a gritty, survivalist, coming-of-age tale, wherein Lara was much younger than in the previous games and was forced into a world of violence and treasure-hunting. The first two games were definitely solid and had a lot of fans - in fact, many have drawn comparisons with Sony's wildly popular Uncharted series, albeit with slightly better combat. Unfortunately, I personally am not a fan of either survival mechanics or combat when it comes to video games, so while many did enjoy the new experiences, I felt like I was left largely in the cold. That's why Shadow of the Tomb Raider was such a positive experience for me.</p>
            
            <p>Now, I completely understand why some people would dislike this game, particularly if they liked the previous two. It's also generally not perfect, has some pretty big flaws and is generally probably a 7/10 experience for most people, but if you value the same things as I do in this series, I would definitely recommend that you give it a go! To me personally, the majority of the additions to this game were things that I really missed in the Tomb Raider franchise, for example, the desolate, moody atmospheres of Tomb Raider (1996) and Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation. In particular, the things I enjoyed were as follows (which may or may not be positives for you):</p>

                    <h3>Beautiful Locales</h3>
                    <h5>One of things I love about the original Tomb Raiders is being able to explore gorgeous, exotic areas that I don't get to see much of in real life. 2013 and Rise were full of muddy / snow areas that were technically gorgeous but aesthetically kind of bland (with some exceptions). Here, however, the jungles and tombs were absolutely stunning, and I enjoyed wandering through this world even when the level design wasn't up to scratch.</h5>

                <div class="opinion-grid-item">
                    <h3>Less fighting, more puzzles</h3>
                    <h5>The main thing I dislike about this franchise is the combat, which has always been, in my opinion, merely serviceable, and only existed to break up the pacing between the main meat of the game - the puzzles and platforming. After the shootbang-fest of 2013 and Rise (which again, was mechanically very sound, just not what I personally enjoy) I thought I would get more of the same in Shadow. This wasn't the case at all - until the last few hours, there are genuinely very, very few combat encounters, and most of the game is based on puzzle-solving and platforming. And the puzzles are actually pretty good - I would say roughly on par with something from Legend. It's honestly kind of surreal to see a modern AAA game with such a massive focus on puzzles, and is very welcome.</h5>

                <div class="opinion-grid-item">
                    <h3>Tombs!</h3>
                    <h5>This is self-explanatory but this has been the main appeal of the series for me from day one, feeling like Indiana Jones as you avoid traps and solve puzzles in ancient tombs. This was mostly relegated to side-missions in the last two games, but here it is the main focus, and the main quest takes you through loads of tombs, not to mention all the side content and DLC, all of which is very high quality.</h5>

            </div>
            
            <p>Now, unfortunately, the flaws that are there are pretty severe, the main one being the story, which is just agonisingly bad and incredibly boring. What makes it even worse is that there are a lot of slow walking sections so you can't even skip cutscenes (which I ended up doing a lot of towards the end). Also, with these types of Indiana Jones stories you run into the risk of running into white-saviour / colonialist tropes, and unfortunately I think the narrative here is quite bad in this regard. Lara is constantly correcting native people about their own culture, interfering in their affairs and getting people killed through her own actions, and I don't think the writing really holds her accountable for any of this. I think this is more to do with bad writing rather than any specific ill intent but it definitely rubbed me the wrong way as I was playing it.</p>
            
            <p>Also, the platforming is as automatic as ever, but to be honest we have been in this boat since Tomb Raider Legend, and I have given up on a modern game having the brilliant control scheme of the original Tomb Raiders (brilliant in my opinion - I know a lot of people would disagree!) so it's not such a big deal.</p>
            
            <p>So if you like the original Tomb Raider series, and miss raiding tombs and solving puzzles, I would give this one a go, even if you had written off the reboot trilogy like I had! </p>
