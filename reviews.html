                    <p>Fans of Psychonauts have been waiting for a sequel for over fifteen years. With Microsoft's funding, Double Fine studio have finally managed to finish their successor to the 3D platformer cult classic, and I am delighted to say that it does not disappoint. The game's storyline and characters are incredibly rich, and overall the plot goes to some very dark places. Thankfully, the heavy themes are dealt with extremely well, and the humour is as sharp as ever to help alleviate some of the more mature elements of the plot. <a href="gallery.html">Click here to see Psychonauts 1 in our gallery of greatest games of all time!</a></p>

                    <p>Following the success of the Resident Evil 2 remake, it didn’t take Capcom long to remake another classic in the hit survival horror franchise. Unfortunately, unlike the 2019 remake, Resident Evil 3 just doesn’t match the highs that last year’s game did.</p>
                    <p>While the core gameplay is still very enjoyable - and the game looks absolutely stunning visually - Resident Evil 3 is just incredibly short, taking approximately five hours to complete on a blind run. Sadly, the game is also very linear, lacking the stressful exploration that made RE2 so much fun to play. It's still Resident Evil - just  worse than previous entries.</p>

                    <p>Taking inspiration from the heavy choice-and-consequence gameplay of classic CRPGs like Planescape: Torment and Fallout, Disco Elysium is an absolutely stunning return to form for the genre.</p> 
                    <p>Taking place in an Eastern European-inspired fantasy city, you play the role of a dysfunctional detective trying to solve a politically-charged murder involving local industry barons and union leaders, with brilliant writing reminiscent of Neil Gaiman and Douglas Adams. One of the best games I have played this generation.

                    <p>Modern gamers will be very familiar with the Fallout games developed by Bethesda and Obsidian. The roots of the franchise, however, lie in the original two isometric titles that came out in the 90s.</p>
                    <p>What strikes me most about playing the very first Fallout game in 2021 is just how much freedom you have as a player to pursue your goals. It feels liberating to be dropped in a world with only a vague objective and being told that you can achieve it any way you see fit. The controls may feel dated, but this is still very much a class RPG worth experiencing today.</p>
